On my new laptop.
Back after a long hiatus.
Looking forward to all the hell I can break loose :D

Almost done with the basic stuff.. Have gotten ubuntu up to date.
Done with installing java.

What's remaining is eclipse, ruby, vlc -- surprising how little the list of programs I really use is!!

Well, something had to happen... wily werewolf had a lot of freezing issues.. it froze up after playing 20 minutes of media. bother! Going back a notch... Working on Trusty Tahr.. Hope it lives up to its name!!
